Doctor: How long has this been going on and do you know how you injured yourself?
Patient: I think that it was about six months ago that the weakness in my leg started. I don't really remember how it happened. 
Doctor: Can you tell me what you do remember? 
Patient: I was reaching to get something from a cabinet, and I noticed that I was unable to stand on my right toe. Ever since then I have had difficulty pushing off when walking.  My toes were tingling and numb.
Doctor: Was the numbness and tingling mild, moderate, or severe? 
Patient: It was a mild feeling, but this has been an ongoing problem that has been the same since the weakness started. 
Doctor: Have you had any other pain any where else in your body? 
Patient: I have had back pain, but this has been going on for many years and has not changed.  
Doctor: Is the back pain been mild, moderate, or severe? 
Patient: I would say mild. I have also been having cramping in both calves. 
Doctor: How long has that been going on? 
Patient: For the past year but it stopped about two months ago.  
Doctor: Have you had any weakness in the left leg? 
Patient: No. I don't think so. 
Doctor: Have you had any pain around right leg and the area of numbness and tingling? 
Patient: No. Everything that is going on with my right leg has pretty much been the same since it started six months ago. I have not gotten worse or better. 
Doctor: Have you had any bowel or bladder incontinence? Any radicular pain?
Patient: No.
Doctor: When did you first see a doctor for the issue? I remember that you told me you saw a different provider prior to coming to see me.
Patient:  I saw the other doctor in October. That was a couple of months before I came to see you. 
Doctor: I see in your chart that we did a CT scan that shows degenerative changes, but nothing obviously abnormal. Remind me why we did not do a MRI of your spine? 
Patient: I cannot have an MRI because of my ear implant.  
Doctor: That is unfortunate. It looks like we were able to do an EMG and nerve conduction studies. What medications are you taking currently? 
Patient: I had an elevated CK before I started taking stat medications.
Doctor: What medications are those? 
Patient: I am not taking Lipitor anymore. I think I took it for about fifteen months. 
Doctor: Do you know what your levels of your CK were before you started taking medication? 
Patient: I thought that my CK was in the five hundred or six hundreds prior to starting it. Once I started it, my levels increased to about eight hundred and then came down to about five hundred again when it was stopped. I recently stopped taking Lipitor because my levels were up to the thousand's and then my CK apparently has returned to about the five hundreds or six hundreds.  
Doctor: I don't see any labs in your chart. Did your primary do labs for your CK levels? 
Patient: Yes, he did. 
Doctor: Okay. Have you started any other medications?
