Doctor: Can you tell me what you do remember?

Doctor: Have you had any bowel or bladder incontinence? Any radicular pain?
Patient: No.
Doctor: When did you first see a doctor for the issue? I remember that you told me you saw a different provider prior to coming to see me.
Patient:  I saw the other doctor in October. That was a couple of months before I came to see you. 
Doctor: I see in your chart that we did a CT scan that shows degenerative changes, but nothing obviously abnormal. Remind me why we did not do a MRI of your spine? 
Patient: I cannot have an MRI because of my ear implant.  
Doctor: That is unfortunate. It looks like we were able to do an EMG and nerve conduction studies. What medications are you taking currently? 
Patient: I had an elevated CK before I started taking stat medications.
Doctor: What medications are those? 
Patient: I am not taking Lipitor anymore. I think I took it for about fifteen months. 
Doctor: Do you know what your levels of your CK were before you started taking medication? 
Patient: I thought that my CK was in the five hundred or six hundreds prior to starting it. Once I started it, my levels increased to about eight hundred and then came down to about five hundred again when it was stopped. I recently stopped taking Lipitor because my levels were up to the thousand's and then my CK apparently has returned to about the five hundreds or six hundreds.  
Doctor: I don't see any labs in your chart. Did your primary do labs for your CK levels? 
Patient: Yes, he did. 
Doctor: Okay. Have you started any other medications?

Guest_clinician: This is a thirty-seven-year-old, left-handed male. He visited us one month ago for headaches, nausea, and vomiting. His exams from that time showed no evidence of bowel obstruction and he was released home.
Doctor: Was there any improvement after your discharge, sir?
Patient: No, I had the same symptoms on and off after that. 
Doctor: What problems are you facing now?
Patient: I am seeing things blurred and having difficulty concentrating. My headaches are worse when sitting up. I notice them first thing in the morning. 
Doctor: How would you describe your headaches? 
Patient: They're dull, constant, and it feels like as if my head is wrapped in a tight band. 
Doctor: Your headache starts from which part of your head? 
Patient: It normally starts on the forehead and then it kind of goes to the back. It happens like six times a day. Lying down or putting my head down between my knees helps.
Doctor: What else do you feel along with your headaches? 
Patient: Like I told the Nurse here before, I get blurry eyesight, nausea and there is vomiting. Any kind of bright light hurts. I'm just afraid of loud sounds. 
Guest_clinician: I discussed with him about any blind spots, positive visual phenomena, weakness, numbness, tingling or double vision or any speech disorder, but he denies everything.
Doctor: How about your weight? 
Patient: It has been going up and down like for over past three months. I was one hundred and sixty three and then I know it was one hundred and forty eight at a point. 
Guest_clinician: Today his weight is one hundred and fifty four pounds.
Doctor: How are you eating habits in the last, let's say, one month?
