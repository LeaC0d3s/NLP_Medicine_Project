Patient: Hello! It is nice to meet you. 
Doctor: What brings you into see me today? 
Patient: I have had this weakness in my right leg for quite some time now.
Doctor: How long has this been going on and do you know how you injured yourself?
Patient: I think that it was about six months ago that the weakness in my leg started. I don't really remember how it happened. 
Doctor: Can you tell me what you do remember? 
Patient: I was reaching to get something from a cabinet, and I noticed that I was unable to stand on my right toe. Ever since then I have had difficulty pushing off when walking.  My toes were tingling and numb.
Doctor: Was the numbness and tingling mild, moderate, or severe? 
Patient: It was a mild feeling, but this has been an ongoing problem that has been the same since the weakness started. 
Doctor: Have you had any other pain any where else in your body? 
Patient: I have had back pain, but this has been going on for many years and has not changed.

Doctor: Have you had any weakness in the left leg? 
Patient: No. I don't think so.

Patient:  I saw the other doctor in October. That was a couple of months before I came to see you. 
Doctor: I see in your chart that we did a CT scan that shows degenerative changes, but nothing obviously abnormal. Remind me why we did not do a MRI of your spine? 
Patient: I cannot have an MRI because of my ear implant.  
Doctor: That is unfortunate. It looks like we were able to do an EMG and nerve conduction studies. What medications are you taking currently? 
Patient: I had an elevated CK before I started taking stat medications.
Doctor: What medications are those? 
Patient: I am not taking Lipitor anymore. I think I took it for about fifteen months. 
Doctor: Do you know what your levels of your CK were before you started taking medication? 
Patient: I thought that my CK was in the five hundred or six hundreds prior to starting it. Once I started it, my levels increased to about eight hundred and then came down to about five hundred again when it was stopped. I recently stopped taking Lipitor because my levels were up to the thousand's and then my CK apparently has returned to about the five hundreds or six hundreds.

Patient: Yes, doctor. Guess what, I just had my seventy seventh birthday. 
Doctor: Happy birthday!
Patient: Thank you, doctor. 
Doctor:  Just to confirm, ma'am, you identify as White, correct? 
Patient: Thank you. Yes, doctor. That's correct. 
Doctor: Okay, walk me through this. So, you've seen doctor X Y Z before, correct?

Doctor: You were having right leg pain when you saw him? 
Patient: Yes. 
Doctor: Have you ever had surgery on your back? 
Patient: Yes, I had spinal stenosis, so they did, um, a laminectomy. 
Doctor: How did you respond to the procedure? 
Patient: Well, I had lower back pain and some arthritis in my spine after. 
Doctor: How have you been treated for these following the surgery? 
Patient: Um, Doctor X Y Z did some injections into my lower back. 
Doctor: Do you remember which side it was in?
Patient: It was in the right side, L2-L3.
Doctor: When was the last time you had these injections into the lower back?
Patient: The last one was in March of two thousand five. 
Doctor: How did your symptoms progress following the injections? 
Patient: Well, I went back to Doctor X Y Z, and then he thought that the symptoms I was having were coming from my right hip. 
Doctor: Did he do any imaging on this hip? 
Patient: Yes, I had some done when I saw him on, um, August fourth two thousand four. 
Doctor: Okay, the x rays we took today show marked degenerative changes, and a progression since the x rays taken back in August when you saw Doctor X Y Z. 
Patient: Oh no. Oh, he also did the injections into my right hip. 
Doctor: When was that?
Patient: Um, it was on April seventh two thousand five, and the last time I saw him was April fifteenth. 
Doctor: Is that when you had the last injections? 
Patient: Correct. 
Doctor: Has anyone talked to you about doing a hip replacement?
Patient: Yes, but right now I'm not sure if I want to do it. 
Doctor: Are you still having pain in that right hip today?
Patient: Yes, it still hurts. 
Doctor: What makes the pain worse? 
Patient: Well, anything that puts weight on this hip hurts really bad. 
Doctor: Okay, if it hurts that bad you should be using a cane. Did you ever get one?
Patient: Yes, I used one to come in here today, in fact. 
Doctor: Good. Do you have any other appointments scheduled?
Patient: Yeah, I made an appointment with an orthopedist in Newton. It's closer to my house. 
Doctor: That's fine. What medicines are you taking? 
Patient: Um, I take the generic for Ultracet. Sometimes I take as many as four times a day.

    conversation: Doctor: Hello, sir. How are you doing today? 
Patient: I hurt my left wrist again. 
Doctor: Oh, no. Again? Did you hurt it before?
Patient: Yeah, I did. I've actually hurt it a lot. The most recent one was probably the worst pain of my life. 
Doctor: I see. How did you hurt it? 
Patient: I was lifting some things out of the trunk of my car, and it started hurting.

Patient: It's the right one. It's been on and off and it's been happening for the last several weeks. 
Doctor: Can you elaborate what's happening? 
Patient: Sometimes I feel like a lot of pins and needles are hurting my hand while other times it is totally numb. 
Doctor: Did anything change in your daily routine? 
Patient: I don't think there have been any big changes. But after I started having these episodes of numbness and tingling, I moved my keyboard down at work. I just hope that it will help. I was just worried if I had carpal tunnel. 
Doctor: What does a normal day look like? What is it like at work? 
Patient: I have a typical office job. I sit in front of the computer for eight hours and mostly work on a keyboard. I hardly take two coffee breaks in between and a lunch break. It is the same kind of thing I'm doing again and again every day. 
Doctor: Is it the same day or night? 
Patient: Oh, it is bad at night, how I'm sleeping. If I sleep in a certain way, then I will wake up with a lot of tingling. Then I must literally shake my hands out to get rid of this tingling. It's just-- it's all so much an it irritates me that it's affecting my mental health.
Doctor: Is it in your whole hand or some specific fingers? 
Patient: It is mostly in my middle finger, but sometimes I also get this on the first or the second finger of my right hand. Sometimes I have pain in my thumb as well. Do you think it is arthritis? 
Doctor: I don't think so. But we can get a test done to confirm it if you want.","Based on the conversation provided, I would classify it into the following category:
