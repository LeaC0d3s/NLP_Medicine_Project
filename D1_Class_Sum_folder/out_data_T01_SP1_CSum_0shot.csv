Doctor: What brings you into see me today?

Doctor: How long has this been going on and do you know how you injured yourself?
Patient: I think that it was about six months ago that the weakness in my leg started. I don't really remember how it happened. 
Doctor: Can you tell me what you do remember? 
Patient: I was reaching to get something from a cabinet, and I noticed that I was unable to stand on my right toe. Ever since then I have had difficulty pushing off when walking.  My toes were tingling and numb.
Doctor: Was the numbness and tingling mild, moderate, or severe? 
Patient: It was a mild feeling, but this has been an ongoing problem that has been the same since the weakness started.

Patient: No.
Doctor: When did you first see a doctor for the issue? I remember that you told me you saw a different provider prior to coming to see me.
Patient:  I saw the other doctor in October. That was a couple of months before I came to see you. 
Doctor: I see in your chart that we did a CT scan that shows degenerative changes, but nothing obviously abnormal. Remind me why we did not do a MRI of your spine? 
Patient: I cannot have an MRI because of my ear implant.  
Doctor: That is unfortunate. It looks like we were able to do an EMG and nerve conduction studies. What medications are you taking currently?

Patient: I am not taking Lipitor anymore. I think I took it for about fifteen months.

Doctor: Yeah, tell me did you follow the meal plan that we gave to you? 
Patient: I tried for many weeks to follow that meal plan that you gave me. 
Doctor: Okay, did it help?

Patient: I tried my best. But I feel like I am not doing it correctly or something. 
Doctor: Okay, tell me what kind of activities are you doing? How much physical activity are you doing on a regular basis? 
Patient: I try to walk around one and a half to two miles like every other day, but I'm spending more time in my garden and doing the yard work by myself. 
Doctor: That's good. Gardening gets-- can get hard and it helps you keep active. 
Patient: Oh yes, picking up all those pots from here to there and knowing that backyard of mine, it's a hard job. 
Doctor: Tell me what brings you here today? Like how can I help you? 
Patient: So, I think the meal plan that you gave was not working for me and there was definitely some weight gain, so I went back to my old South Beach Diet. 
Doctor: Okay. What were the results with your South Beach Diet then? Was it effective? 
Patient: I was able to get some pounds off. I felt pretty good about it. 
Doctor: That's good. Then what's the issue? 
Patient: Well, you see, deep in my heart I know this South Beach Diet is not a healthy diet for me and that's why I'm back to you. 
Doctor: I appreciate your honesty. You don't know how happy you made me by saying that. 
Patient: Yeah. You know, I'm here. So, tell me what to do to lose all this extra weight and how to enforce a low fat diet? What are your recommendations for that?
