### Using Hard Prompts to Control and Enhance LLM Performance for Medical Classification and Summarization Tasks from MEDIQA-2023

This GitHub Project is created to give additional information about code used and the resulting outputs generated.


The "D1/D2" at the beginning of each folder name refers to the template used for the prompt input. Each template has the results for the Classification only task and the joined Classification and Summarization Task in a seperate folder.
