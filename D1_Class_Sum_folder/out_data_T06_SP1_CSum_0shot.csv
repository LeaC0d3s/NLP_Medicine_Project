Doctor: Can you tell me what you do remember? 
Patient: I was reaching to get something from a cabinet, and I noticed that I was unable to stand on my right toe. Ever since then I have had difficulty pushing off when walking.  My toes were tingling and numb.

Patient: No.
Doctor: When did you first see a doctor for the issue? I remember that you told me you saw a different provider prior to coming to see me.
Patient:  I saw the other doctor in October. That was a couple of months before I came to see you. 
Doctor: I see in your chart that we did a CT scan that shows degenerative changes, but nothing obviously abnormal. Remind me why we did not do a MRI of your spine? 
Patient: I cannot have an MRI because of my ear implant.  
Doctor: That is unfortunate. It looks like we were able to do an EMG and nerve conduction studies. What medications are you taking currently?
