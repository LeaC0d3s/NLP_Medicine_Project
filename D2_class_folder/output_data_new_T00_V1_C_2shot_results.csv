Doctor: Can you tell me what you do remember? 
Patient: I was reaching to get something from a cabinet, and I noticed that I was unable to stand on my right toe. Ever since then I have had difficulty pushing off when walking.  My toes were tingling and numb.
Doctor: Was the numbness and tingling mild, moderate, or severe? 
Patient: It was a mild feeling, but this has been an ongoing problem that has been the same since the weakness started. 
Doctor: Have you had any other pain any where else in your body? 
Patient: I have had back pain, but this has been going on for many years and has not changed.  
Doctor: Is the back pain been mild, moderate, or severe?

Doctor: I see in your chart that we did a CT scan that shows degenerative changes, but nothing obviously abnormal. Remind me why we did not do a MRI of your spine? 
Patient: I cannot have an MRI because of my ear implant.  
Doctor: That is unfortunate. It looks like we were able to do an EMG and nerve conduction studies. What medications are you taking currently?

Doctor: What medications are those? 
Patient: I am not taking Lipitor anymore. I think I took it for about fifteen months.

Once I started it, my levels increased to about eight hundred and then came down to about five hundred again when it was stopped. I recently stopped taking Lipitor because my levels were up to the thousand's and then my CK apparently has returned to about the five hundreds or six hundreds.

Doctor: Good morning, ma'am. You're here for a follow up, correct? 
Patient: Yes, doctor. Guess what, I just had my seventy seventh birthday. 
Doctor: Happy birthday!
Patient: Thank you, doctor. 
Doctor:  Just to confirm, ma'am, you identify as White, correct? 
Patient: Thank you. Yes, doctor. That's correct. 
Doctor: Okay, walk me through this. So, you've seen doctor X Y Z before, correct? 
Patient: Yes, that's right. I saw him for low back pain and lumbar scoliosis post laminectomy syndrome, lumbar spinal stenosis, and symptomatic right L two radiculopathy.
Doctor: You were having right leg pain when you saw him? 
Patient: Yes. 
Doctor: Have you ever had surgery on your back? 
Patient: Yes, I had spinal stenosis, so they did, um, a laminectomy. 
Doctor: How did you respond to the procedure? 
Patient: Well, I had lower back pain and some arthritis in my spine after. 
Doctor: How have you been treated for these following the surgery? 
Patient: Um, Doctor X Y Z did some injections into my lower back. 
Doctor: Do you remember which side it was in?
Patient: It was in the right side, L2-L3.
Doctor: When was the last time you had these injections into the lower back?
Patient: The last one was in March of two thousand five. 
Doctor: How did your symptoms progress following the injections? 
Patient: Well, I went back to Doctor X Y Z, and then he thought that the symptoms I was having were coming from my right hip. 
Doctor: Did he do any imaging on this hip? 
Patient: Yes, I had some done when I saw him on, um, August fourth two thousand four. 
Doctor: Okay, the x rays we took today show marked degenerative changes, and a progression since the x rays taken back in August when you saw Doctor X Y Z. 
Patient: Oh no. Oh, he also did the injections into my right hip. 
Doctor: When was that?
Patient: Um, it was on April seventh two thousand five, and the last time I saw him was April fifteenth. 
Doctor: Is that when you had the last injections? 
Patient: Correct. 
Doctor: Has anyone talked to you about doing a hip replacement?
Patient: Yes, but right now I'm not sure if I want to do it. 
Doctor: Are you still having pain in that right hip today?
Patient: Yes, it still hurts. 
Doctor: What makes the pain worse? 
Patient: Well, anything that puts weight on this hip hurts really bad. 
Doctor: Okay, if it hurts that bad you should be using a cane. Did you ever get one?
Patient: Yes, I used one to come in here today, in fact. 
Doctor: Good. Do you have any other appointments scheduled?
Patient: Yeah, I made an appointment with an orthopedist in Newton. It's closer to my house. 
Doctor: That's fine. What medicines are you taking? 
Patient: Um, I take the generic for Ultracet. Sometimes I take as many as four times a day.
