This GitHub Project is created to give additional information about code used and the resulting outputs generated for the above mentioned University Seminar Paper in NLP Medicine.


The "D1/D2" at the beginning of each folder name refers to the template used for the prompt input. Each template has the results for the Classification only task and the joined Classification and Summarization Task in a seperate folder.
